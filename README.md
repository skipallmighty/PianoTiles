PianoTiles
==========
This is PianoTiles the game written in Swift. It is incomplete as it does not have the menu. It also does not throw a game over if you hit the wrong tile but it does only let you click black tile. It also has a timer. It is counting the right number of tiles but it isn't using that number to do anything. This is quick version of the main functionality. Feel free to implement the rest.
